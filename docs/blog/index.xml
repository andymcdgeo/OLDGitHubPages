      <description>Taking well log plots one step further using Python and matplotlib Well log plots are a common visualization tool within geoscience and petrophysics. They allow easy visualization of data (for example, Gamma Ray, Neutron Porosity, Bulk Density, etc) that has been acquired along the length (depth) of a wellbore.</description>

      <description>Appending Multiple LAS Files to a Pandas Dataframe Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files are a common Oil &amp;amp; Gas industry format for storing and transferring well log data. The data contained within is used to analyze and understand the subsurface, as well as identify potential hydrocarbon reserves.</description>

      <description>Adding lithology information to a well log plot can enhance a petrophysical or geological interpretation. It can be used to understand why some log responses may behave the way they do. This data may have been sourced from a previous mineralogical interpretation or from mud logs.</description>

      <description>Introduction Borehole image logs are false-color pseudo images of the borehole wall generated from different logging measurements/tools. How borehole images are acquired differs between wireline logging and logging while drilling (LWD). In the wireline environment measurements are made from buttons on pads that are pressed up against the borehole wall and provide limited coverage, but at a high resolution.</description>

      <description>Matplotlib is a great library to work with in Python and it is one that I always go back to time and time again to work with well logs. Due to its high degree of flexibility it can be tricky to get started with it at first, but once you have mastered the basics it can become a powerful tool for data visualization.</description>

      <description>Core data analysis is a key component in the evaluation of a field or discovery, as it provides direct samples of the geological formations in the subsurface over the interval of interest. It is often considered the ‘ground truth’ by many and is used as a reference for calibrating well log measurements and petrophysical analysis.</description>

      <description>Once data has been collated and sorted through, the next step in the Data Science process is to carry out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This step allows us to identify patterns within the data, understand relationships between the features (well logs) and identify possible outliers that may exist within the dataset.</description>

      <description>Steve Francia   Anyone who has worked or is currently working within the oil and gas industry will understand that there are a large variety of formats that well log data can be stored in. Some of the common formats that we as petrophysicists work with include LAS, ASCII and CSV files.</description>

      <title>Visualising Well Data Coverage Using matplotlib</title>

      <description>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an integral part of Data Science. The same is true for the petrophysical domain and can often be referred to as the Log QC or data review stage of a project. It is at this stage that we begin to go through the data in detail and identify what data we really have, where we have it and what is the quality of the gathered data.</description>

      <title>Petrophysics: Gamma Ray Normalization in Python</title>
      <link>http://andymcdgeo.github.io/blog/2020-10-18-petrophysics-gamma-ray-normalisation-in-python/</link>

      <description>Normalization of well log data is a common and routine process within a petrophysical workflow and is used to correct for variations in logging curves between wells. These variations can arise due a number of different reasons such as incorrect tool calibrations, varying tool vintage and changes in borehole environmental conditions between the wells.</description>
