Hi! Iâ€™m Andy. I am a petrophysicist / data scientist within the oil in gas industry and based in Aberdeen, Scotland. I have over 14 years experience petrophysics, log analysis and geology. Over the years I have developed my skills in Python and continuing to learn everyday.

When I am not doing my day job I can be found out with the camera photographing nature, catching up on the latest SpaceX launches or learning about productivity and Notion.  

Feel free to check out my projects below and explore the website. If you want to get in touch you can send a message via the contact form at the bottom of the page.
